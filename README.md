Lack of documentation from conflunet.

Confluent has shared wrong enterprise licnse key , due to which we are blocked completey for 2 weeks and the resoluition gave finally after rasising so many support calls.

No Proper referance architecture  are solution shared by the confluenet with case studues as examples.
For example exposing of confluent REST Proxy outside of external Nestle is pendig for a long time.
Neslte Architecture Forum is not accpetes dues to secutiry contarints in REST Proxy, though conflunet involved in the calls with Nestle but no propoer solution recommeded by the Confluent.

Resoltion or turn aroung time for the tickets raised to confluent from Nestle is too slow.
